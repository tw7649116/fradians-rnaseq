# Fragilaria radians RNA-seq data analysis

These commands were used to process the data and generate figures for the manuscript "De novo transcriptome assembly and analysis of the freshwater araphid diatom Fragilaria radians (the former name Synedra acus subsp. radians) isolated from Lake Baikal" by Galachyants et al.

#### Please note: the shared code can only be used to get understanding of how the data analyses were performed. It should not be treated as a ready-to-use software for transcriptome analysis.
